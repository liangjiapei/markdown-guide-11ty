<p><em><a href="https://www.markdownguide.org">The Markdown Guide</a></em> is a comprehensive Markdown reference designed for both novices and experts. It was born out of frustration with existing Markdown references that are incomplete and inadequate.</p>
<h2>Contributing</h2>

<ul>
<li>Make sure you have Node.JS installed on your computer. See https://nodejs.org/en/</li>
<li><code>npm install</code></li>
