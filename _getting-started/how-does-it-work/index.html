<h2>How Does it Work?</h2>
<p>Dillinger makes writing in Markdown easy because it hides the stuff happening behind the scenes, but it's worth exploring how the process works in general.</p>
<p>When you write in Markdown, the text is stored in a plaintext file that has an <code>.md</code> or <code>.markdown</code> extension. But then what? How is your Markdown-formatted file converted into HTML or a print-ready document?</p>
<p>The short answer is that you need a <em>Markdown application</em> capable of processing the Markdown file. There are lots of applications available — everything from simple scripts to desktop applications that look like Microsoft Word. Despite their visual differences, all of the applications do the same thing. Like Dillinger, they all convert Markdown-formatted text to HTML so it can be displayed in web browsers.</p>
<p>Markdown applications use something called a <em>Markdown processor</em> (also commonly referred to as a &quot;parser&quot; or an &quot;implementation&quot;) to take the Markdown-formatted text and output it to HTML format. At that point, your document can be viewed in a web browser or combined with a style sheet and printed. You can see a visual representation of this process below.</p>
<div class="alert alert-info">
  <i class="fas fa-info-circle"></i> <strong>Note:</strong> The Markdown application and processor are two separate components. For the sake of brevity, I've combined them into one element ("Markdown app") in the figure below.

<p>To summarize, this is a four-part process:</p>
<ol>
<li>Create a Markdown file using a text editor or a dedicated Markdown application. The file should have an <code>.md</code> or <code>.markdown</code> extension.</li>
<li>Open the Markdown file in a Markdown application.</li>
<li>Use the Markdown application to convert the Markdown file to an HTML document.</li>
<li>View the HTML file in a web browser or use the Markdown application to convert it to another file format, like PDF.</li>
</ol>
<p>From your perspective, the process will vary somewhat depending on the application you use. For example, Dillinger essentially combines steps 1-3 into a single, seamless interface — all you have to do is type in the left pane and the rendered output magically appears in the right pane. But if you use other tools, like a text editor with a static website generator, you'll find that the process is much more visible.</p>
