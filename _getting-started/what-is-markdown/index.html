<h2>What is Markdown?</h2>
<p>Markdown is a lightweight markup language that you can use to add formatting elements to plaintext text documents. Created by <a href="https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">John Gruber</a> in 2004, Markdown is now one of the world's most popular markup languages.</p>
<p>Using Markdown is different than using a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WYSIWYG">WYSIWYG</a> editor. In an application like Microsoft Word, you click buttons to format words and phrases, and the changes are visible immediately. Markdown isn't like that. When you create a Markdown-formatted file, you add Markdown syntax to the text to indicate which words and phrases should look different.</p>
<p>For example, to denote a heading, you add a number sign before it (e.g., <code># Heading One</code>). Or to make a phrase bold, you add two asterisks before and after it (e.g., <code>**this text is bold**</code>). It may take a while to get used to seeing Markdown syntax in your text, especially if you're accustomed to WYSIWYG applications. The screenshot below shows a Markdown file displayed in the <a href="/tools/vscode/">Visual Studio Code text editor</a>.</p>

<p>You can add Markdown formatting elements to a plaintext file using a text editor application. Or you can use one of the many Markdown applications for macOS, Windows, Linux, iOS, and Android operating systems. There are also several web-based applications specifically designed for writing in Markdown.</p>
<p>Depending on the application you use, you may not be able to preview the formatted document in real time. But that's okay. <a href="https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">According to Gruber</a>, Markdown syntax is designed to be readable and unobtrusive, so the text in Markdown files can be read even if it isn't rendered.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The overriding design goal for Markdown’s formatting syntax is to make it as readable as possible. The idea is that a Markdown-formatted document should be publishable as-is, as plain text, without looking like it’s been marked up with tags or formatting instructions.</p>
