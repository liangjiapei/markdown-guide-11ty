<p><a href="https://casual-effects.com/markdeep">Markdeep</a> is a free and simple tool that turns any Markdown file into a self-contained HTML file that can be viewed in a web browser. There's nothing to install and there's no service to register for â€” you simply add one line of code to the bottom of your Markdown file. This is a great option if you need to quickly view a Markdown file in a web browser or share a Markdown file with someone who needs to view the rendered output.</p>
<p>Using Markdeep is a three-part process:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Add the following tag for Markdeep on a single line at the bottom of a Markdown file.</p>
<p><code>&lt;!-- Markdeep: --&gt;&lt;style class=&quot;fallback&quot;&gt;body{visibility:hidden;white-space:pre;font-family:monospace}&lt;/style&gt;&lt;script src=&quot;markdeep.min.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;script src=&quot;https://casual-effects.com/markdeep/latest/markdeep.min.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;script&gt;window.alreadyProcessedMarkdeep||(document.body.style.visibility=&quot;visible&quot;)&lt;/script&gt;</code></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Rename the Markdown file to add the <code>.md.html</code> extension (i.e., <code>myfile.md.html</code>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Open the file in a web browser to see the rendered output.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>This tool has a lot of features beyond what's described here. For example, you can choose from a variety of templates to customize the look of your page. Markdeep also supports diagrams, LaTeX typesetting for equations, and much more. Check out the excellent <a href="https://casual-effects.com/markdeep">documentation</a> for the full details.</p>
