<p><a href="https://standardnotes.org">Standard Notes</a> is an elegant, open-source note taking application with an excellent feature set. Markdown support is not provided by default, but by paying for the optional <a href="https://standardnotes.org/extensions">subscription</a>, you can enable one of several Markdown extensions available to subscribers. I used the <a href="https://standardnotes.org/extensions/advanced-markdown">Advanced Markdown extension</a>, which is what's documented below.</p>
