<p><a href="https://mattermost.com">Mattermost</a> is an open source enterprise messaging and team collaboration application. It's like <a href="/tools/slack/">Slack</a>, but with excellent Markdown support. In fact, Mattermost provides exactly the type of Markdown support you want to see in a messaging application. You can type messages in Markdown or copy and paste Markdown-formatted text into the message field â€” it works exactly the way you'd expect it to. The application uses <a href="https://github.com/mattermost/marked">a fork of the marked Markdown processor</a>.</p>
