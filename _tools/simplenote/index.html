<p><a href="https://simplenote.com">Simplenote</a> is a basic note-taking application developed by Automattic, the same company that created WordPress. The application is free and available on every platform, including Linux. It's also <a href="https://simplenote.com/developers/">open source</a>. You can use Simplenote in your web browser.</p>
<p>After you download the application, you'll be prompted to create an account. That account is used to back up your notes to Automattic's servers and synchronize your notes across all of your other devices. Note that Automattic <a href="https://simplenote.com/help/#encryption">doesn't encrypt your content</a> on their servers. You can't disable the synchronizing feature.</p>
<p>Export options are limited, but the <em>Publish to Web</em> feature allows you to share your notes on the internet with a public URL.</p>
<h3>Enabling Markdown Support</h3>

<h3>Previewing Markdown Documents</h3>
<p>Simplenote doesn't use a live editor. You'll continue to see the Markdown-formatted text after you've typed it. To preview Markdown documents in Simplenote, click the Preview Markdown icon â€” it looks like an eye.</p>
