<p><a href="https://www.mkdocs.org">MkDocs</a> is a static site generator designed for building documentation websites.  Written in the Python programming language, MkDocs is an open-source project with a lot of community support. A variety of <a href="https://github.com/mkdocs/mkdocs/wiki/MkDocs-Themes">themes</a> are available. In terms of Markdown support, MkDocs does an excellent job supporting the basic syntax elements, but it lacks support for some extended syntax elements.</p>
<p>The application uses the <a href="https://python-markdown.github.io/">Python-Markdown</a> Markdown processor. You can enable additional <a href="https://www.mkdocs.org/user-guide/configuration/#markdown_extensions">extensions</a>.</p>

<h3>Using Admonitions</h3>
<p>Here's a handy feature: You can enable an extension to use <a href="https://python-markdown.github.io/extensions/admonition/">admonitions</a> in MkDocs. This is a quick and easy way to start using notes, warnings, and tips on your MkDocs site. See this <a href="https://github.com/mkdocs/mkdocs/issues/1659">GitHub issue</a> for more information and examples.</p>
