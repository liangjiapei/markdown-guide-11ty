<p><a href="https://trello.com">Trello</a> is a popular kanban-style project management application that can be used for everything from project management to making grocery shopping lists. You create a board, add columns (called &quot;lists&quot;), and then add cards to lists. The interactive drag-and-drop interface allows you to easily reorder cards and move them between lists as you work on tasks.</p>
<p>Trello has excellent support for basic Markdown syntax. You can use Markdown in the card descriptions, checklists, and comments. You can also use Markdown for your Trello bio. Not all formatting is properly displayed when viewed in the iOS and Andriod applications.</p>
