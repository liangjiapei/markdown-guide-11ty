<p><a href="https://gohugo.io">Hugo</a> is a popular static site generator written in the Go programming language. Hugo is jam-packed with features, but one of its main selling points is speed â€” Hugo takes mere seconds to generate a site with thousands of pages. <a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2017/03/a-little-surprise-is-waiting-for-you-here/">Smashing Magazine</a> recently switched to Hugo from WordPress.</p>
<p>Hugo has excellent Markdown support out of the box. By default, Hugo uses the <a href="https://github.com/yuin/goldmark/">Goldmark</a> Markdown processor which is fully CommonMark-compliant. See the <a href="https://gohugo.io/getting-started/configuration-markup/">configuration instructions</a> to learn more about the extensions you can configure. You can change Hugo's Goldmark settings in the <code>config.toml</code> file, as shown below.</p>
<pre><code class="language-toml">baseURL = &quot;http://mysite.org/&quot;
languageCode = &quot;en-us&quot;
title = &quot;My Site&quot;
theme = &quot;ananke&quot;
