<p>With NotesHub, your notes truly belong to you and not any particular vendor. All of your data is stored in Git repositories, so you can clone them and manage outside the app.</p>
<p>You can use Markdown to format your notes and create tables, lists, images, and more. Markdown will keep your notes in the same style regardless of whether you copied text from the internet or wrote it from scratch.</p>
<p>NotesHub is a progressive web application you can use on any device. You can install it or use it as website.</p>
