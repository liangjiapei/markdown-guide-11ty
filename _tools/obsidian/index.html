<p><a href="https://obsidian.md/">Obsidian</a> is a relatively new entrant in the increasingly crowded Markdown knowledge base and note-taking market. Obsidian's excellent Markdown support and its simple, straightforward design makes it a standout application in the category. <a href="https://obsidian.md/download">Desktop</a> and <a href="https://obsidian.md/mobile">mobile</a> applications are available.</p>

<p>Obsidian sports virtually all of the standard fare common to the other applications in this category, but it ups the ante by including a number of other features for power users. There's a visually-striking graph view that's a kind of &quot;mind map&quot; of all your files stored in Obsidian, a &quot;Markdown format importer&quot; that can find and replace certain Markdown syntax elements in your files, and support for <a href="https://publish.obsidian.md/help/How+to/Format+your+notes">math</a> and <a href="https://publish.obsidian.md/help/How+to/Format+your+notes">diagram</a> syntax. That really just scratches the surface of Obsidian's capabilities. Obsidian is extensible, and there are dozens of free community plugins available within the application.</p>
<p>Two other features are worth mentioning. Obsidian provides a simple way to publish notes to the internet, and it stores all of your files in plaintext Markdown files containing only the text you enter.</p>
