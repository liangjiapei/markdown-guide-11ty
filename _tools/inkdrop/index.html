<p><a href="https://www.inkdrop.app">Inkdrop</a> is a Markdown note-taking app with a great feature set. You create an account on the Inkdrop website (free trial available, then monthly subscription required), download the desktop and mobile applications, and start writing. Organizing notes is easy with notebooks, statuses, and tags.</p>
<p>One of the best parts of Inkdrop is that it's extensible. A variety of plugins allow you to add flowcharts, sequence diagrams, and (my personal favorite) <a href="https://github.com/libeanim/inkdrop-admonition">admonitions</a>. And, on a note somewhat unrelated to the application itself, you might be interested in learning that Inkdrop's developer is a <a href="https://blog.inkdrop.info/">prolific blogger</a> who takes <a href="https://docs.inkdrop.app/security">security seriously</a>.</p>
