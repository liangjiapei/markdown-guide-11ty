<p><a href="https://www.squarespace.com">Squarespace</a> is a popular subscription service for building websites. The service features a drag-and-drop interface that lets you build websites right in your web browser. One of the components available for webpages is a <em>Markdown block</em> â€” a content area that supports Markdown. You'll see the option when you click the Add Block icon, as shown below.</p>

<p>Squarespace supports most basic Markdown syntax elements, but support for a number of extended syntax elements is lacking. One disadvantage is that the editor for the Markdown block is a tiny box and the text is displayed in a minuscule (and non-adjustable) font size. You're probably better off copying and pasting the text in from another application.</p>
<h3>Markdown Support</h3>
<p>provides support for the following Markdown elements.</p>
<table class="table table-bordered" style="font-size: 14px">
  <thead class="thead-light">

      <th style="width: 30%">Element</th>
