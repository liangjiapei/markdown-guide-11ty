<p><a href="https://ghost.org/">Ghost</a> is a relatively new content management system (CMS) for blogging that competes with older, established CMS products like WordPress and Drupal. Ghost is an open source project renowned for its speed, simplicity, and ease of use. Markdown support is standard and available out-of-the-box.</p>

<p>There are a couple minor compatibility issues noted below but, generally speaking, Ghost has solid Markdown support. The live editor is fairly intuitive and seems like a good choice for bloggers. Copying and pasting Markdown-formatted text into the editor works the way you'd expect it to.</p>
<h3>Ghost Markdown Support</h3>
<p>Ghost provides support for the following Markdown elements.</p>
<table class="table table-bordered" style="font-size: 14px">
  <thead class="thead-light">
    <tr>
      <th style="width: 30%">Element</th>
      <th style="width: 15%">Support</th>
      <th style="width: 55%">Notes</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
  </tbody>
</table>
<h3>Support for Additional Syntax Elements</h3>
<p>As an added bonus, Ghost provides support for several obscure elements.</p>
<table class="table table-bordered" style="font-size: 14px">
  <thead class="thead-light">
    <tr>
      <th>Element</th>
      <th>Markdown</th>
      <th>Rendered Output</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
