<p>With Markdown, <a href="https://www.reddit.com">Reddit</a> text formatting is a breeze. All Reddit users have the option of writing comments and posts in Markdown. The popular news website has developed its own Markdown processor called &quot;snoomark&quot; which is based on GitHub-Flavored Markdown. Some have started referring to this as &quot;Reddit-flavored Markdown.&quot; For a deep dive into Reddit's Markdown support, see <a href="https://www.reddit.com/wiki/markdown">this wiki article</a>.</p>
<h3>Enabling Markdown Support</h3>
<p>By default, Reddit disables Markdown support for new posts and comments. You can switch from the rich text editor to Markdown by clicking the <strong>Switch to markdown</strong> link, as shown below.</p>
