<p>To create a blockquote, add a <code>&gt;</code> in front of a paragraph.</p>
<pre><code>&gt; Dorothy followed her through many of the beautiful rooms in her castle.
</code></pre>
<p>The rendered output looks like this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Dorothy followed her through many of the beautiful rooms in her castle.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Blockquotes with Multiple Paragraphs</h3>
<p>Blockquotes can contain multiple paragraphs. Add a <code>&gt;</code> on the blank lines between the paragraphs.</p>
<pre><code>&gt; Dorothy followed her through many of the beautiful rooms in her castle.
&gt;
&gt; The Witch bade her clean the pots and kettles and sweep the floor and keep the fire fed with wood.
</code></pre>
<p>The rendered output looks like this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Dorothy followed her through many of the beautiful rooms in her castle.</p>
<p>The Witch bade her clean the pots and kettles and sweep the floor and keep the fire fed with wood.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Nested Blockquotes</h3>
<p>Blockquotes can be nested. Add a <code>&gt;&gt;</code> in front of the paragraph you want to nest.</p>
<pre><code>&gt; Dorothy followed her through many of the beautiful rooms in her castle.
&gt;
&gt;&gt; The Witch bade her clean the pots and kettles and sweep the floor and keep the fire fed with wood.
</code></pre>
<p>The rendered output looks like this:</p>

<h3>Blockquotes with Other Elements</h3>
<p>Blockquotes can contain other Markdown formatted elements. Not all elements can be used — you'll need to experiment to see which ones work.</p>
<pre><code>&gt; #### The quarterly results look great!
&gt;
&gt; - Revenue was off the chart.
&gt; - Profits were higher than ever.
&gt;
&gt;  *Everything* is going according to **plan**.
</code></pre>
<p>The rendered output looks like this:</p>
<blockquote>
<h4 class="no-anchor">The quarterly results look great!</h4>
<ul>
<li>Revenue was off the chart.</li>
<li>Profits were higher than ever.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Everything</em> is going according to <strong>plan</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Blockquotes Best Practices</h3>
<p>For compatibility, put blank lines before and after blockquotes.</p>
<table class="table table-bordered">
  <thead class="thead-light">
    <tr>
      <th>✅&nbsp; Do this</th>
      <th>❌&nbsp; Don't do this</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
        <code class="highlighter-rouge">
        Try to put a blank line before...<br><br>
<pre><code>    &gt; This is a blockquote&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

    ...and after a blockquote.
    &lt;/code&gt;
  &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt;
    &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;
    Without blank lines, this might not look right.&lt;br&gt;
    &gt; This is a blockquote&lt;br&gt;
    Don't do this!
    &lt;/code&gt;
  &lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
</code></pre>
