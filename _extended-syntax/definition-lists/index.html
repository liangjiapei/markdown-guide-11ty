<p>Some Markdown processors allow you to create <em>definition lists</em> of terms and their corresponding definitions. To create a definition list, type the term on the first line. On the next line, type a colon followed by a space and the definition.</p>
<pre><code>First Term
: This is the definition of the first term.

Second Term
: This is one definition of the second term.
: This is another definition of the second term.
</code></pre>
<p>The HTML looks like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-html">&lt;dl&gt;
  &lt;dt&gt;First Term&lt;/dt&gt;
  &lt;dd&gt;This is the definition of the first term.&lt;/dd&gt;
  &lt;dt&gt;Second Term&lt;/dt&gt;
  &lt;dd&gt;This is one definition of the second term. &lt;/dd&gt;
  &lt;dd&gt;This is another definition of the second term.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>The rendered output looks like this:</p>
<p>First Term
: This is the definition of the first term.</p>
<p>Second Term
: This is one definition of the second term.
: This is another definition of the second term.</p>
