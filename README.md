# Markdown Guide

[![Build Status](https://github.com/mattcone/markdown-guide/workflows/tests/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://github.com/mattcone/markdown-guide/actions)

*[The Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org)* is a comprehensive Markdown reference designed for both novices and experts. It was born out of frustration with existing Markdown references that are incomplete and inadequate.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome. Feel free to open a pull request with changes.

- Make sure you have Node.JS installed on your computer. See https://nodejs.org/en/
- `npm install`
